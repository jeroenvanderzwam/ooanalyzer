# Factexporter analyzer in Ghidra for OOAnalyzer

This factexporter is used to explore if the decompilation capabilities of Ghidra can improve the decompilation results of object
oriented constructs in [OOAnalyzer](https://github.com/cmu-sei/pharos/blob/master/tools/ooanalyzer/ooanalyzer.pod).

The factexporter was created during a research that looked to improve the decompilation of C++ code. 
The research was done at the *Open Universiteit* in the Netherlands.

The main contributor is [Jeroen van der Zwam](https://github.com/jeroenvanderzwam).

This analyzer is run inside the [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/ framework).
To install Ghidra and the factexporter analyzer follow the [Ghidra installation guide](https://ghidra-sre.org/InstallationGuide.html).

For convenience it is also possible to import the analyzer with the provided [zip file](ghidra_11.0_PUBLIC_20240112_FactExporter.zip)
